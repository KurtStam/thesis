The distribution of nationalities remains relatively constant through editions with American artists increasing through time and French artists decreasing.\n\nAs *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* evolves through time, diversity of gender and race increases while the diversity of ethnicity increases until the third edition in 1948, then decreases. The distribution of nationalities remains fairly constant through time, with an increase in American artists in the second edition in 1936, then a decrease until the fifth edition in 1970, then a continual increase until the latest edition in 2020. German artists enter the book in the third edition (1948) and increase through time. French artists decrease until the third edition, increase until the fifth, then decrease through the latest edition.\n\n### Count Through Editions\n\nIn @fig-gardnercountthroughtime, the shape of the overall count of works by artists in *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* is heavily left-skewed, multimodal, and asymmetrical. Such highlights how through time, more works are, on average, continually added to *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* that are two-dimensional and made after c. 1750. The first edition, published in 1926 by Helen Gardner, only has a total of 21 works. Edition 15, published in 2016 as well as edition 16, published in 2020, have 182 works respectively, which is the maximum amount of works through all editions.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Overall Count of Artists in Gardner's Art Through the Ages, n= 2325.

Additionally, this visualization shows that the first edition in 1926 contains no female artists in our scope, but that starting in the second edition in 1936, Helen Gardner began including female artists. *Gardner's History of Art* included female artists in the scope of two-dimensional works after c. 1750 50 years earlier than *Janson's History of Art.*\n\nThe overall percentage of male artists through all books of *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* is 85.69%, roughly a 4.5% increase in regard to gender diversity as compared to *Janson's History of Art.* Through time, gender becomes increasingly more diverse in *Gardner's Art Through the Ages*, yet there is still incredible underrepresentation of female artists.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Gender of Artists in Gardner's Art Through the Ages, n= 2325.

Additionally, @fig-jansongenderthroughtime shows that the first two editions (the first three books cataloged: edition 1, first printing, edition 1, second printing, and edition 2) written by H. W. Janson and Dora Jane Janson, contain no women. Anthony Janson, who took over authorship for the third edition in 1986, began including discourse surrounding female artists. Notably, he was extremely proud of himself for diversifying his family's art history survey text.[^results-1]\n\n[^results-1]: anthony janson interview\n\nThe overall percentage of male artists through all books of *Janson's History of Art* is 89.99%.

The most diverse a single edition has gotten thus far is just under 15% being non-white. Interestingly enough, the two editions that are least racially diverse are the seventh and eighth editions which were published in 1980 and 1986 respectively. There is a significant jump in black representation in the eleventh edition, as well as other non-white artists as the percentage of non-white artists goes from just under 4% in the tenth (1996) to close to 14% in the eleventh (2001).\n\nArtist race through editions in *Gardner's Art Through the Ages,* hovers at just around 95% white until the eleventh edition in 2001, where there was roughly a 10% increase in non-white artists. From the eleventh edition (2001) to the sixteenth (2020) the ratio of white artists to non-white artists remains fairly stagnant. The overall percentage of white artists through all editions of *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* is 90.02%.\n\nThe first named Asian artist in any edition of *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* was Suzuki Harunobu in the third in 1959. @fig-suz displays his work, *The Evening Glow of the Ando (Night Lantern).* He remains within *Gardner's History of Art* through the latest 16th edition (2020).\n\n![Suzuki Harunobu. *The Evening Glow of the Ando (Night Lantern)*. 1765.

The only two black artists to be included in all editions from then on are Aaron Douglas and Henry Ossawa Tanner. Douglas' work *Noak's Ark* is highlighted in @fig-ark, he incorporates African motifs and sculpture into Synthetic Cubism through the use of silhouettes and pushing the boundary of flatness. There is only one clause in the paragraph describing Douglas in Gardner's eleventh edition that comments on his demographic, \"Encouraged by the German artist Winold Reiss to create art that would express the cultural history of his race...\"[^results-2] There is far less discourse about the artist as a minority but rather more regarding the artist and his work. Though *Gardner's* still discusses Douglas through the lens of a white male artist, Winold Reiss, *Gardner's* does comparably much better in regard to including as well as in regard to how they include in this particular example, black artists.\n\n[^results-2]: gardner 11, page 1030\n\n![Aaron Douglas.

W. Janson and Dora Jane Janson, there were only white artists included. Through time, race diversity does increase, but very minimally and remains stagnant through editions after the fifth (1995). The ratio of white artists to non-white artists per edition never dips below 95%, as denoted by the horizontal line. The overall percentage of white artists through all editions of *Janson's History of Art* is 97.37%. Race is the most limiting category of demographic statistically speaking in *Janson's History of Art.*\n\nWhen Anthony Janson took over authorship, he included a handful of black artists, then in the fifth edition, he added an artist by the name of Kay Walkingstick (1935-present), who is a Native American woman. She was included through the sixth edition then removed when the group of six professors took over.\n\nAnthony Janson states in the fifth edition that Walkingstick combines \"Neo-Expressionism and Neo-Abstraction in a particularly fruitful way...\"[^results-3] The work in @fig-kay was brought forth after the death of her husband in 1989, as she outpours her grief onto the canvas. The left panel, as Janson writes, is \"built up in thick coats of paint applied mainly by her hands,\" with a fan shape in the center which suggests a manmade feature in a primitive landscape and also acts as a sign, investing the canvas mysterious emblematic significance. The right half was painted in an Expressionist style and releases anger through the various layers of color. Walkingstick's diptych display aspects of nature as a spiritual center, of calm contemplation, powerful emotion, and order in chaos.

The only black artist that enters *Janson's History of Art* in the third edition (1986) and remains through the latest edition (2011) is painter Henry Ossawa Tanner (1859-1937). Notably, in the fifth edition by Anthony Janson, he begins his discourse on Tanner with,\n\nThanks in large part to \\[Thomas\\] Eakins' enlightened attitude, Philadelphia became the leading center of minority artists in the United States. Eakins encouraged women and blacks to study art seriously at a time when professional careers were closed to them. African-Americans has no chance to enter the arts before Emancipation, and after the Civil War the situation improved only gradually. [^results-5]\n\n[^results-5]: Janson's fifth edition, 724.\n\nJanson is seemingly distracted by Tanner's race and how Thomas Eakins provided space for him rather than beginning discourse directly about the aesthetics and significance of Tanner's work itself. He only mentions Tanner's name in the following sentence, allotting only half of the area of text to the history of the artist and the work itself.\n\nIn the fifth edition of Janson's History of Art, Anthony Janson chose to include, @fig-banjo *The Banjo Lesson,* which he painted after he moved permenantly to Paris, which \"bears Eakins' unmistakable influence.\"[^results-6] Tanner, who is described as the \"first important black painter\" is given space in the text, yet is not properly and independently discussed.\n\n[^results-6]: Janson fifth edition, 724.\n\n![Henry Ossawa Tanner, The Banjo Lesson, c. 1893.

In Janson's eighth edition, the group of six authors highlights the use of flatness in Hiroshige's composition as shown in @fig-ando. The flatness he employs is used to discuss how the \"spatial contraction of Japanese prints certainly influence Degas and Manet...\"[^results-7] Similarly to the example of Tanner, Hiroshige stands as another example of a minority artist included to be compared to the work of a white male artist.\n\n[^results-7]: Janson Edition 8, 871.\n\n![Ando Hiroshige, Plum Estate, Kamiedo, from the series One Hundred Famous Views of Edo. 1857.

This edition was published after her death, but she has passed with the intention of her book being a representation of the world's history of art. Her efforts are evident in the percentage of artists of Hispanic and Latino origin which is just under 22%. It is clear that her succeeding authors did not continue with such an ethnically diverse selection of artists, which has remained under 9% in every other publication. Artists of Hispanic or Latino origin increases until the third edition in 1959, then begin to decrease through time and remain stagnant at just under 7% through the latest edition published in 2020.\n\nThe overall percentage of artists who are not of Hispanic or Latino origin included in *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* is 91.51%.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Ethnicity of Artists in Gardner's Art Through the Ages, n= 2325.

This may be because the overall count of artists was so few that having only a handful of artists from Hispanic or Latino origin accounted for just under 9% of the overall count of artists in the 1963 publication. The percentage of artists of Hispanic or Latino origin decreases through time until the sixth edition (2001), where the percentage begins to slowly increase in the seventh (2007) and eighth editions (2011).\n\nThe overall percentage of artists who are not of Hispanic or Latino origin included in *Janson's History of Art* is 95.82%.\n\n### Nationality Through Editions\n\nIn the visualization above, @fig-gardnernationalitythroughtime, the percentage of American artists spikes in 1936 in edition two, then begins to decrease until edition five (1970), in which the ratio of American artists hits a low of under 10%, then steadily begins to increase until the latest edition published in 2020. The percentage of French artists in the first edition in 1926 is roughly 40% which then decreases through edition three to roughly 25%. The ratio of French artists then begins to grow once more until the fifth edition (1970), which shows the percentage of French artists as roughly 50%. From the fifth edition, the ratio of French artists decreases through time. Notably, German artists only enter the book in the thired edition in 1959 as roughly 2% of artists. Through time, the ratio of representation of German artists grows to about 10% and then remains stagnant.\n\nThe overall percentage of artists who are French, American, British, German, or Spanish through all editions of *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* is 76.58%.
