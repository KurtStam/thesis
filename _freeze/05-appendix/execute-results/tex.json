Of the total count of artists through all editions of *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* and *Janson's History of Art*, 77.32% account for French, Spanish, British, American and German. Therefore, the categorical strings of this variable are French, Spanish, British, American, German and Other.\n\n`whitney_count_to_year` = The count of exhibitions held by The Whitney of a particular artist at a particular moment of time, as highlighted by `year`.\n\n`moma_count_to_year` = The count of exhibitions held by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) of a particular artist at a particular moment of time, as highlighted by `year`.\n\n`year` = The year of publication for a given edition of Janson or Gardner.\n\nOther variables:\n\n`edition_number` = The edition number of the textbook from either Janson's History of Art or Gardner's Art Through the Ages.\n\n`book` = Which book, either Janson or Gardner the particular artist at that particular time was included.\n\n`artist_unique_id` = A unique identifying number assigned to artists across books and editions denoted in alphabetical order.\n\n## Log Transformation: Total Space Ratio per Page\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![enter figure caption here](05-appendix_files/figure-pdf/fig-logspaceratioperpagetotal-1.pdf){#fig-logspaceratioperpagetotal}\n:::\n:::\n\nIn order to create less skew in our outcome variable, it is evident that log transforming total space ratio per page given to an artist in a particular edition gives the spread a much more mild right-skew than before. The shape is still unimodal and asymmetrical. I will be using the log transformation on the total space ratio per page, our outcome variable, in the linear mixed-effects model. This allows for the residuals to have constant variance.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n## Assumptions\n\n### Residuals and Constant Variance\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![enter figure caption here](05-appendix_files/figure-pdf/fig-residuals-1.pdf){#fig-residuals}\n:::\n:::\n\nThe very low values of the predicted values have very low variability for residuals but for the bulk of the data, there is constant variability in the residuals.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n### Normality\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![enter figure caption here](05-appendix_files/figure-pdf/fig-density-histogram-1.pdf){#fig-density-histogram}\n:::\n:::\n\nThe distribution of the residuals is approximately normal.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n### Independence\n\nSince we cannot assume that each row in our data set is independent from another, because we expect an artist effect, we added a random effect at the artist level. Between artists, we expect the observations to be independent.\n\n### Collinearity\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='add caption here'}\n::: {.cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                                                 GVIF Df GVIF^(1/(2*Df))\nartist_nationality_other                     1.822957  5        1.061885\nmoma_count_to_year                          10.422907  1        3.228453\nartist_nationality_other:moma_count_to_year 16.196330  5        1.321118\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nGiven artist nationality, MoMA Count to Year and the interaction between the two all have a corrected GVIF under 10 therefore no variables are collinear.",
