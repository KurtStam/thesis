Additionally, this paper investigates which external variables such as artist gender, ethnicity, race, nationality, number of exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, and number of exhibitions at The Whitney if any, help predict the magnitude of an artist's inclusion in art history survey texts. I conduct data analysis to assess the demographic representation of artists through editions of *Janson's History of Art* and *Gardner's Art Through the Ages*, a proxy for the art history survey. I compare artist demographics through editions of Janson and Gardner. My findings indicate that coverage of minority artists (defined as non-white and/or from Hispanic or Latino origin and/or female) increases across editions of *Janson's History of Art* and *Gardner's Art Through the Ages*, but remains negligible compared to white male artists not from Hispanic or Latino origin. Moreover, in *Janson's History of Art* through all editions, the percentage of artists who are white is 97.37%, the percentage of artists that are male is 89.99%, and the percentage of artists that are not Hispanic or Latinx is 95.82%. In *Gardner's Art Through the Ages*, through all editions, the percentage of artists who are white is 90.02%, the percentage of artists that are male is 85.69%, and the percentage of artists that are not Hispanic or Latinx is 91.51%. Both texts display a narrative of the history of art as being predominantly white, male, non-Hispanic or Latinx. Regarding nationality, in Janson, 78.51% of the artists are American, British, French, German, and Spanish, which is very similar to Gardner's 76.58% of those five same nationalities. I have chosen to run a linear mixed-effects model with a random effect of the artist's name, to infer the magnitude of the space given to a particular artist divided by the area of the page of the given edition (total space ratio per page), in *Janson's History of Art* and *Gardner's Art Through the Ages,* using the potential predictor variables: artist race, gender, ethnicity, nationality, the count to year of the number of exhibitions an artist has at the MoMA, and the count to year of the number of exhibitions an artist has at The Whitney. The model that best explains the variance in the total space ratio per page per artist per edition uses artist nationality and the count to year of the number of exhibitions an artist has in the MoMA as well as the interaction between those two variables. With a log transformation applied to the outcome variable as it is heavily right-skewed, my linear mixed-effects model yields a conditional r squared of 53.23%. Such denotes that 53.23% of the variance of total space ratio per page given to an artist in a given edition can be explained by the model.\n\nJEL Numbers: C80, Y10, Z11\n\nKey Words: Cultural

Context\n\n## Inspiration for Research:\n\nHeading into the second semester of my junior year, I scheduled a zoom meeting with my now undergraduate thesis advisor, Prof. Hans van Miegroet, to ask a few questions about my aspirations after college. He had been my professor for his course, \"History of Art Markets,\" a learning experience at Duke that has permanently altered my worldview. The meeting began with me expressing my enjoyment of the course, and the appreciation of the discussion of transparency in the buying and selling of art. I asked his opinion of whether I should stick to studying architectural history with hopes of going to architecture school, or pivot to do further research under him in his graduate course, \"Arts and Markets\" that I had enrolled in for that Spring. Towards the end of the meeting, he asked me what I found most interesting about art, to which I replied, \"Ever since I took my first Art History course, I've always been curious as to why I am introduced to the works I am. Who is choosing what I study versus what I don't study?\" I explained to him. I had initially learned the story of art through Marilyn Stokstad's, *Art History* my final year of high school. At the end of that school year, I inquired to my teacher, Carolyn Paczkowska, in a class discussion, \"Why are we studying the works that we have?\" The class discussed gatekeepers of art and information and later ended in the conclusion of uncertainty. Prof. van Miegroet looked at me through the computer screen and stated I had found my research question for my Undergraduate Honors Thesis, that I had found my why.\n\nMy research began solely looking at how art history textbooks changed through time, then developed into looking at using a linear mixed-effect model with a log transformation on my outcome variable to infer which external variables would if at all work to predict the magnitude of space (of text and of the figure of their work or works) given to an artist in a given book.\n\n## Why *Gardner's Art Through the Ages:*\n\nFirst published in 1926 by Helen Gardner, *Gardner's History of Art* is widely considered as the first single-volume survey of the world's art.[^chapter1-1] Her introductory survey text far surpassed other available works in readability, breadth of coverage, and wealth of illustration.[^chapter1-2] The latest edition, the sixteen, of the art history survey text, was published in 2020. *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* has the longest publishing history and evolution that displays the changing nature of an art history survey text.\n\n[^chapter1-1]: Kader, Themina. \"The Bible of Art History: Gardner's Art through the Ages.\" Studies in Art Education 41, no. 2 (Winter, 2000): 176.\n\n[^chapter1-2]: britannica but look if info is on lee's art historian dictionary\n\nGardner's initial success can be quantified by the statistic that the first two editions, published a decade apart, as stated by art education researcher from Pennsylvania State University, Kader Themina, \"sold 260,000 copies, a testimony to the popularity of her book.\" Additionally, as highlighted by a team of researchers at Purdue in as recent as 2020, \"Art history instructors use and rely on Gardner's global coverage...\"[^chapter1-3] In a footnote in that same publication, an unnamed art historian, in an email to the authors, states \"Gardner's Art Through the Ages is, by a wide margin, the best-selling introduction to the history of art in the English language and the number one test in North American high school and university courses.\"\n\n[^chapter1-3]: purdue 14\n\nAdd any more sales information if you can, and state if you cannot find anything else on it.\n\nThough it is unclear where this information is coming from, it is clear that *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* is a phenomenal proxy of how the overall narrative of the history of art is changing through time.\n\n### Discourse of Authorship:\n\n**(**Discourse of dominance through time of the text, find and add sources and if available sales information through time)\n\nREACH OUT FOR SALES DATA TO PUBLISHERS\n\nBritannica\n\n-   The lack of a [comprehensive](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comprehensive) single-volume textbook on art history prompted Gardner to write one herself, and the resulting Art Through the Ages (1926) far surpassed other available works in readability, breadth of coverage, and wealth of illustration. It remained a widely used text for decades. In 1932 she published Understanding the Arts, aimed at a wide general audience. A second edition of Art Through the Ages, greatly expanded, appeared in 1936; **the first two editions sold more than 260,000 copies.** Gardner had been named an assistant professor in the Art Institute school in 1929, and in 1933 she became a professor and head of the department of art history. She retired from the Art Institute school in 1943. Despite declining health she managed to complete work on the manuscript of a third edition of Art Through the Ages (published in 1948).\n\nSources Found to Looking Into:\n\n-   Franciscono, Marcel.\n    1977. \"History, Textbooks, and Art: Reflections on a Half Century of Helen Gardner's \"Art through the Ages\".\" Critical Inquiry 4 (2) (Winter): 285. https://login.proxy.lib.duke.edu/login?u rl=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/history-textbooks-art-reflections-on-half-century/docview/1297337757/se-2?a ccountid=10598.\n-   Jaffee, Barbara. \"9. \"Gardner\" Variety Formalism: Helen Gardner and Art through the Ages\" In Partisan Canons edited by Anna Brzyski, 203-224.

Alexandra Peers in her publication for ARTnews.com in February of 2006, claims that \"it was Janson who, more than any other art historian, pioneers the 'in and out' celebrity model of art history. There were artists who matter, he argued, and those who didn't.\"[^chapter1-12] Janson's formation of his history of art is not only arguably the most dominant art history survey over time, but also he holds a reputation of being a gatekeeper of art history. He states at the end of his introduction in the first and second editions that after having read his text, one \"shall have joined the active minority that participates directly in shaping the course of art in our time.\"[^chapter1-13] He recognizes his role as an individual who shapes the narrative of the history of art, while convincing the reader that after having read his text, one has the agency to be a gatekeeper alongside him . Such agency is only granted once one understands his digestion of the most important works and artists through time .\n\n[^chapter1-12]: Alexandra Peers, \"Canon Fodder,\" Artnews.com, (February 1, 2006), https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/canon-fodder-135/.\n\n[^chapter1-13]: H. W. Janson and Dora Jane Janson, (1963),  History of Art: A Survey of the Major Visual Arts from the Dawn of History to the Present Day, First Edition, Second Printing, New York: Harry N. Abrams: 17.\n\nIt would be most comprehensive if we were to have access to the total number of sales per edition of Janson's History of Art, to use as tangible data to show the relevance and importance of the text through time. Both publishers, Harry N. Abrams and Prentice-Hall (now Pearson Prentice-Hall) have declined sharing sales information in the aggregate. By leafing through various scholarly publications, there is imperfect data of sale information worth noting when discussing the dominance of Janson's History of Art through time. The text was at its height of sales between when it was initially released in 1962 through H. W. \"Peter\" Janson's death in 1982 (refer to Table 1 for complete information of each edition). Art historian, Patricia Hills cites in her publication in Artforum, \"in 1973 the Janson text had 46% of the market, while Gardner's 5th edition had 24%, followed by Gombrich's, 8.5%, Cleaver with 3% and miscellaneous 'other' with 18.5%.\"[^chapter1-14] At the time such a report had been made, the first edition (1962), the first edition revised and enlarged (1969) had been released. Additionally, it was written by John Russell of the New York Times in October of 1982 that \"well over two million copies have been sold.\"[^chapter1-15] Russell does not specify whether these sales numbers are solely the first edition of Janson's History of Art, or the first edition as well as the first edition revised and enlarged and the second edition (1977) . He also added that the text had been \"translated in 14 languages and is widely regarded as both an essential teaching instrument and a book that can be read and looked at with continuous enjoyment.\"[^chapter1-16] Here, Russell perpetuates the significance of Janson's survey, as well as providing information about the breadth of Janson's text, reaching more than solely English-reading audience s.\n\n[^chapter1-14]: Market Research Report on Introductory Art History, dated March 15, 1972, prepared for McGraw-Hill College Textbook Division and Follow-up Report, dated Spring, 1973.

The narrative remained significant from the third (1986) through the fifth edition (1995), which were all revised by Anthony \"Tony\" F. Janson, son of Peter and Dora Jane. Ingalls states that \"the fourth edition, published in 1991, sold 21,000 copies the first year and an average of 11,000 copies a year in the past four years. The new fifth edition, has sold more than 13,000 copies since its March release.\"[^chapter1-18] She continues, \"Although its sales have been eclipsed over the last 10 years by another perennial favorite, R.H. Gardner's Art Through the Ages, Janson is still the standard in many people's minds.\"[^chapter1-19] Notably, she does not mention any total sales information about Gardner's survey text, just that over the past decade (1985-1995), its sales trumped that of Janson' s.\n\n[^chapter1-17]: Zoë Ingalls, \"A Son Revises His Father's Classic Art-History Textbook,\" The Chronicle of Higher Education, (August 11, 1995), https://www.chronicle.com/article/a-son-revises-his-fathers-classic- art-history-textbook/.\n\n[^chapter1-18]: Zoë Ingalls, \"A Son Revises His Father's Classic Art-History Textbook,\" The Chronicle of Higher Education, (August 11, 1995), https://www.chronicle.com/article/a-son-revises-his-fathers-classic- art-history-textbook/.\n\n[^chapter1-19]: Zoë Ingalls, \"A Son Revises His Father's Classic Art-History Textbook,\" The Chronicle of Higher Education, (August 11, 1995), https://www.chronicle.com/article/a-son-revises-his-fathers-classic- art-history-textbook/.\n\nAfter the sixth edition (2001) and the sixth edition revised (2004) the last with authorship by Tony Janson, Harry N. Abrams and Prentice Hall were unsatisfied by the total sales, as well as the overall structure and content of the text as they were criticized for having lost touch with young readers.[^chapter1-20] At the same moment, Harry N. Abrams sold all rights to the newly formed Pearson Prentice Hall, who recruited new authorship of six various art historians across the United States: Penelope J. E. Davies, Walter B. Denny, Frima Fox Hofrichter, Joseph Jacobs, Ann M. Roberts, and David L. Simon (refer to Table 2). Such change was received negatively by art historians, which is reflected in the text's further decline in sales. [^chapter1-21] It has been estimated by Bookauthority.com (a cite whose source for this information is very unclear) that the eighth edition revised, published in 2015 has had 2,000 total copies sold, while competing art historical narratives such as Marilyn Stokstad and Micheal W. Cothren's History of Art Vol . 1 has had an estimated 10,000 copies sold since its release in 2017 .[^chapter1-22] Such has left Janson's History of Art as a minor player in art historical narratives today.\n\n[^chapter1-20]: Alexandra Peers, \"Canon Fodder.\"\n\n[^chapter1-21]: Jeffrey Weidman, \"Many Are Culled but Few Are Chosen: Janson's History of Art, Its Reception, Emulators, Legacy, and Current Demise.\" Journal of Scholarly Publishing 38, no. 2 (January 2007): 96. https://muse.jhu.edu/article/209994/pdf.\n\n[^chapter1-22]: \"100 Best-Selling Art HIstory Books of All Time,\" Book Authority, https://bookauthority.org/books/best-selling-art-history-books.\n\n**Table 2:** Edition Number, Year of Publication, Title, Authorship, and Publisher Over Time of All Cataloged Editions of Janson's History of Art.\n\n+--------------------------+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Edition Number           | Year of Publication | Authors                                                                                                     | Title                                                                                         | Publisher (as listed per Edition)[^chapter1-23]                                        |\n+==========================+=====================+=============================================================================================================+===============================================================================================+========================================================================================+\n| 1                        | 1963[^chapter1-24]  | H.W.

He was born in 1913 in St. Petersburg, Russia. His parents were of Swedish and Latvian descent. The family moved to Hamburg, Germany after the Russian Revolution. Janson studied at Munich and then at the University in Hamburg where he was a student of Erwin Panofsky, a prolific art historian known for his contributions to the studies of symbols and iconography in art. In 1935, at the suggestion of his advisor, Janson fled Germany under the sponsorship of Alfred Barr, director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Janson studied at Harvard between 1935 and 1942, completing a PhD in art history. His most significant professorial position began in 1949, where he was appointed professor and later chairman of the department of art at New York University. He remained in such a role for 25 years as he grew the department's prestige, solidifying its reputation as one of the most conservative art history programs in the country. A decade later, in 1959, Janson issued a book titled, Key Monuments of the History of Art, in efforts to aid his undergraduates in their study of art as the availability of good personal study images were not easily accessible. Such publication sparked Janson's History of Art released in 1962, a survey of art written with his wife, Dora Jane Janson.\n\n\\\nBorn Dora Jane Heineberg (1916-2002) in Philadelphia in 1916, she shared a passion for art with Peter. The two met in Cambridge, Massachusetts as she attended Radcliffe College as an undergraduate student while Janson was studying at Harvard. Dora Jane Janson worked with her husband on many publications, but her most notable achievement came in 1971 when she wrote an exhibition catalog for the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke on Art Nouveau jewelry, titled From Slave to Siren: The Victorian Woman and Her Jewelry from Neoclassic to Art Nouveau. Authorship of Janson's History of Art was handed over to one of the couple's four children, Anthony F. Janson, after the sudden passing of Peter Janson in 1982.\n\nAnthony Frederick \"Tony\" Janson was born March 30th, 1943 in St. Louis, Missouri. The Jansons moved to New York in 1949, and Tony Janson frequently visited the city's museums as a child and teenager. In 1954, the Jansons spent a year in Europe. In an interview, Tony Janson describes his attitude upon the family's return to New York as one of \" total rebellion\" eventually causing his parents to search for a school that would engage him better academically.[^chapter1-26] Janson details how he rediscovered a love for learning after enrolling at Riverdale Country School on a full scholarship, and it is at this time that he began to study art history. Janson experimented as an artist himself, and cited his early affection for photography as the reason he was the first to add that medium to a survey textbook of art history. [^chapter1-27] Educated at Columbia and Harvard, Janson was asked to continue the work of his father as author of Janson's History of Art . Unable to revise the entire textbook in time, Janson \"added women, which was long overdue.\"[^chapter1-28] and photography to the textbook for the third editio n. After returning from the Vietnam War, Janson earned his PhD in art history from Harvard and went to teach at the College of Charleston before transitioning to a career as chief curator of the Indianapolis Museum of Ar t. In 1984 Janson moved to the Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida, and then he was Chief Curator of the North Carolina Museum of Art from 1989 to 199 3. Janson spent the rest of his career at UNC Wilmington and retired in 200 2. The last edition of Janson's History of Art that he worked on was the sixth revised, and he viewed his revisions of Janson's History of Art as more in line with his father's approach than the rest of his own scholarshi p.\n\n[^chapter1-26]: Anthony Janson, interview by Sherman Hayes, University of North Carolina Wilmington Archives and Special Collections, (March 15-19, 2007): 11.\n\n[^chapter1-27]: Anthony Janson, interview by Sherman Hayes, University of North Carolina Wilmington Archives and Special Collections, (March 15-19, 2007): 7.\n\n[^chapter1-28]: Anthony Janson, interview by Sherman Hayes, University of North Carolina Wilmington Archives and Special Collections, (March 15-19, 2007): 9.\n\nThe seventh and eighth editions were rewritten by a group of art historians across the United States: Penelope J. E. Davies, Walter B. Denny, Frima Fox Hofrichter, Joseph Jacobs, Ann M. Roberts, and David L. Simon. In Table 2, each author's name, gender, ethnicity and nationality are listed, with question marks next to Frima Fox Hofrichter and Ann M. Roberts' nationality and Joseph Jacob's ethnicity as such information could not be found with full certainty. We observe here a desire to diversify authorship in efforts by the publisher to cater to young readership, and increase sales. Notably, there is gender diversity, with a fifty-fifty split of male to female authorship, though a complete lack of racial diversity, which is a notion reflected additionally in the text itself. Since the Janson name has left the book's authorship, the text has declined significantly from being the most dominant art historical survey.[^chapter1-29]\n\n[^chapter1-29]: Jeffrey Weidman, \"Many are Culled but Few Are Chosen,\" 94.\n\n**Table 3:** Authors of the Seventh and Eighth Editions of Janson's History of Art.\n\n+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Author                | Description (As listed by Publisher)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n+=======================+==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+\n| Penelope J.

Secondly, Weidman discusses the changes of Janson's History of Art between the sixth edition revised, the last edition written by Peter and Tony Janson, and the seventh edition written by the six various art historians (Table 2). He believes that the seventh edition is a disgrace to Janson's text, and the beauty of Janson's analytically writing has been completely stripped in the seventh edition. He also discusses, yet only through a handful of examples, artists and works which were taken out as well as added between the sixth edition revised and the seventh (for a comprehensive understanding of artists taken out and added through time refer to Fig. \\_\\_). Notably, such publication does not discuss data in the aggregate when looking at who is included and excluded, and rather only looks in detail at the changes between the sixth edition revised and the seventh edition.\n\n[^chapter1-30]: Jeffrey Weidman, \"Many Are Culled but Few Are Chosen: Janson's History of Art, Its Reception, Emulators, Legacy, and Current Demise.\" Journal of Scholarly Publishing 38, no. 2 (January 2007): 85-107. https://muse.jhu.edu/article/209994/pdf.\n\nRevising Art History's Big Book: Who's In and Who Comes Out?\n\nThis article published by Randy Kennedy in March of 2006 in the New York Times, also discusses the change between the sixth edition revised and the seventh edition of Janson's *History of Art*.[^chapter1-31] Kennedy looks at only a few artists and works who leave and are added, particularly baffled by the exclusion of James Abbot McNeill Whistler's Arrangement in Black and Gray: The Artist's Mother. He interviews Sarah Touburg, an editor of the seventh edition who claims that upwards of 25% of the book's content had been altered between the sixth edition revised and the seventh edition. Interestingly, Kennedy claims that the new book adds more women and it uses art much more as a way to discuss race, class and gender. Such an observation is not reflected in our data, which can be seen in figures \\_\\_, \\_\\_\\_, and \\_\\_\\_. This publication also discusses the dominance and influence that Janson's History of Art has had over time, as well as its decline as the best-selling art survey in recent years. Kennedy states that a shift in authorship was done in efforts to revitalize Janson's relevance to younger audiences. Though this publication discusses the change between two editions, Kennedy does not do so in the aggregate.\\\n\n[^chapter1-31]: Randy Kennedy, \"Revising Art History's Big Book: Who's In and Who Comes Out?\" New York Times, (March 7, 2006), https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/07/arts/design/revising-art-historys-big-book- whos-in-and-who-comes-out.html.\n\nDiscussions and Depictions of Women in H. W. Janson's History of Art, Fourth Edition\n\nArt historian Paul E. Bolin discusses gender inequality through the first four editions of *Janson's History of Art.*[^chapter1-32] He states that a primary criticism of Janson's text is its lack of attention given to the importance of work of women artists. The first two editions did not include any women, then there was an influx of female artists when Tony Janson claimed primary authorship for the publication of the third edition in 1986. Bolin argues that even with the edition of female artists in the third and fourth editions, there is still not enough representation and that additionally the fashion in which Tony discusses female artists is apologetic and at times problematic. Bolin uses simple statistics in his discourse, having counted a total of 9 out of the 28 new artists added to the fourth edition as female. Bolin does not discuss racial discrimination, nor does he use complete data in the aggregate when looking gender discrimination.\n\n[^chapter1-32]: Paul E. Bolin, \"Discussions and Depictions of Women in H. W. Janson's History of Art, Fourth Edition,\" Journal of Social Theory in Art Education, Vol. 15.(1996), pp. 146-159. https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/51288476.pdf.\n\n## Significance of Research:\n\nAs far as I am aware, there has not been research done in the aggregate, quantitatively analyzing the change over time specifically regarding artist demographic in *Janson's History of Art* nor *Gardner's Art Through the Ages*. My research is significant as it efficiently shows the gaps of representation in terms of gender, nationality, race, and ethnicity that have not been deeply touched on by previous scholars. As mentioned in my literature review of publications that discuss *Gardner's Art Through the Ages,* the closest research I have found to my own was published by The University of Chicago Press Journals in 2020 in which two professors and library assistant out of Purdue University, randomly selected and cataloged information from the first, fifth, twelfth and sixteenth edition. They were focused on how the length of the book changes through time, the type of image changed through time, how the percent of color images change through time, and how the number of suggested readings changes through time. My research has more breadth, as I scraped information from all 16 editions of *Gardner's Art Through the Ages,* as well as *Janson's History of Art* and working less with how the book itself was changing, but more so how the artist's included changes through time.\n\nSecondly, my research looks at how the area given to particular artists changes through time and which, if any, external variables can help account for the variance of such. As mentioned in my abstract, I use a linear mixed-effects model with a random effect of the artist's name, to infer the magnitude of the space given to a particular artist divided by the area of the page of the given edition (total space ratio per page), in *Janson's History of Art* and *Gardner's Art Through the Ages,* using the potential predictor variables: Artist Race, Artist Gender, Artist Ethnicity, Artist Nationality, the count through time of the number of exhibitions an artist has at the MoMA, and the count through time of the number of exhibitions an artist has at The Whitney. The model that best explains the variance in the total space ratio per page per artist per edition uses artist nationality and the count through time of the number of exhibitions an artist has in the MoMA as well as the interaction between those two variables. With a log transformation applied to the outcome variable of the as it is heavily right-skewed, my linear mixed-effects model yields a conditional r squared of 53.23%. Such denotes that 53.23% of the variance of total space ratio per page given to an artist in a given edition can be explained by the artist's nationality and the count through time of the number of exhibitions an artist has at the MoMA. This type of statistical analysis as far as I am aware has not been done in regards to looking at how art historical survey texts evolve. My research works to explain how the authors of *Janson's History of Art* and *Gardner's Art Through the Ages,* operate while choosing which artists are given any particular amount of space in their publications.\n\n## Research Questions:\n\n1.  What are the demographics (artist gender, race, ethnicity, nationality) of artists included in each edition of Janson's History of Art (from 1962-2011) and Gardner's Art Through the Ages (from 1926-2020) looking at two-dimensional works after c. 1750?\n\n    Hypothesis: *Janson's History of Art* and *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* will include more female, nonwhite, Hispanic or Latinx artists over time; however, these artists will still be dramatically underrepresented compared to white male artists. Moreover, race and ethnicity will be more of a limiting factor than gender.\n\n2.  Which variables ( artist gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, number of exhibitions at the MoMA or The Whitney) if any, predict the magnitude of an artist's inclusion in art history survey texts (*Janson's History of Art* and *Gardner's Art Through the Ages*)?\n\n    Hypothesis: I hypothesize demographic information per artist will play a large role in accounting for the total variance in `space_ratio_per_page_total`. The type of race, gender, nationality, and ethnicity of an artist in theory highly impacts how much they are highlighted and discussed in introductory art history texts. Additionally, I hypothesize that if a given artist has many exhibitions in the MoMA or The Whitney, such would additionally account for variance in the outcome variable `space_ratio_per_page`. The notion behind such a hypothesis is that if an artist is being put on exhibition, they are likely to be discussed more in introductory art history texts.\n\n# **Methodology:**\n\n## Data Collection:\n\n### Textbooks:\n\nScope: I collected data from 25 different books. I cataloged 9 different books of *Janson's History of Art*, spanning from 1963 to 2011. Additionally, I cataloged 16 different books of *Gardner's Art Through the Ages,* spanning from 1929 to 2020. I used the particular scope of works produced after c. 1750 that were two-dimensional. This scope allowed me to collect information more quickly to understand how the books were changing over time. Across all 25 books, there are a total of `r nrow(gardnerjanson_museums)` observations, which is the sum of the count of artists in every book. In the finalized, gardnerjanson_museums data set, there are `r ncol(gardnerjanson_museums)` different variables cataloged (for further information about each variable, reference the Data Dictionary). There are a total of 414 unique artists.\n\nOutcome variable:\n\n`space_ratio_per_page_total` = I measured with a ruler with centimeters, the length and width of text per work per artist. If the area of text was not a rectangle, I additionally collected the length and width of any extra text. I then used excel to calculate the total area of the text per work per artist. Then I additionally measured the length and width of the figure in the book of the work itself. Again, using excel, I calculated the area of the figure of the work. I then added together the area of figure of a work with the area of text written about the work, to create a variable of total space given to a work. In order to achieve a ratio between total space and the area of a page is in a respective book, as they are inconsistent, I divided the total area of a page from a respective book with the total space given to a work by an artist in a respective book.\n\nDemographic variables:\n\n`artist_nationality` = I recorded the nationality of the artist as listed by the text. In the case the nationality of the artist was not listed, I would do a quick google search to further research their nationality. If I couldn't find their nationality, I listed such as N/A.\n\n`artist_gender` = I recorded the gender of the artist as listed by the text. In the case the gender of the artist was not listed, I would do a quick google search to further research their gender. If I couldn't find their gender, I listed such as N/A.\n\n`artist_race` = I recorded the race of the artist as listed by the text. I categorized race based on the guidelines of the US Census.[^chapter1-33] In the case the race of the artist was not listed, I would do a quick google search to further research their race. If I couldn't find their race, I listed such as N/A.\n\n[^chapter1-33]: https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html.\n\n    https://www.mobap.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/US-Census-Bureau-Definitions-of-Race-and-Ethnicity.pdf#:\\~:text=Definition%3A%20The%20U.S.%20Census%20Bureau%20adheres%20to%20the,Hispanics%20and%20Latinos%20may%20be%20of%20any%20race.\n\n`artist_ethnicity` = I recorded the ethnicity of the artist as listed by the text. Similarly to race, I categorized ethnicity based on the guidelines of the US Census.[^chapter1-34] In the case the ethnicity of the artist was not listed, I would do a quick google search to further research their ethnicity. If I couldn't find their ethnicity, I listed such as N/A.\n\n[^chapter1-34]: https://www.mobap.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/US-Census-Bureau-Definitions-of-Race-and-Ethnicity.pdf#:\\~:text=Definition%3A%20The%20U.S.%20Census%20Bureau%20adheres%20to%20the,Hispanics%20and%20Latinos%20may%20be%20of%20any%20race.\n\nIdentifying Variables:\n\n`artist_name` = The name of the artist as listed by the respective book. At times, each book would spell names slightly differently, so I standardized names across editions as well as across museum exhibition data for the MoMA and The Whitney.\n\n`year` = I recorded the year of publication of each book.\n\n`edition_number` = I recorded the edition number of each book.\n\n`book` = I recorded which book, either Gardner or Janson, the work was mentioned.\n\nSelection: As argued in the Introduction and Context, *Janson's History of Art* and *Gardner's Art Through the Ages,* are the two most renowned and significant art history introductory texts through roughly the last century.\n\nLimitations: I have limited my data collecting in *Janson's History of Art* and *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* to only including two-dimensional art made after c. 1750. This omits sculpture and architecture and how the story of art changes from the beginning of time to c. 1750. I did such as I am most interested in how the diversity of artists changes through editions, and because it only took roughly 1/5 of the time to catalog as I was only cataloging roughly 1/5 of each book. Additionally, two-dimensional works are more frequently included in museum exhibitions spaces than works of sculpture and architecture. My research would be more robust and complete had I cataloged every work in every edition. I am fully aware of this limitation, yet I believe my conclusions are significant within my scope.\n\n### Museum Data:\n\nScope: My second research question is looking at if / how an artist's inclusion in museums exhibitions impacts the amount of total area an artist is given in a particular book. I initially began this research as a group project for a class titled, \"Art Markets.\" In order to collect information regarding museum exhibitions, my colleague, David Smoot ('21), web scraped the MoMA's website for the entirety of its catalog history from when its doors first opened in 1929 through the date he scraped the MoMA's website which was March 14th, 2021. He did the same thing with The Whitney's website and web scraped their exhibition history from 1933 through when he scraped the website, March 30th, 2021. There was a total of 10,630 observations in the MoMA data set and 13,736 at The Whitney. An observation is an appearance of an artist in an exhibition.\n\nSelection: The Whitney and the MoMA were chosen as they are located in New York City, arguably the center of the art world as we know it, and because of the relative accessibility of historic exhibition data. \n\nLimitations: The inclusion of more museums, both domestically and internationally would lend the museum data sets greater power to provide context, and an independent metric for the importance of the exhibition, such as press coverage, would be more useful as a comparison to the `space_ratio_per_page_total` in the textbook than the number of exhibitions. Also, The Whitney appears to only list their annual shows on their website prior to 1997, so only the MoMA has complete data.\n\nI finished my data collection process with four separate data sets. I had one in which I collected demographic and total space information for the nine books of *Janson's History of Art,* and a second doing the same for the sixteen books of *Gardner's Art Through the Ages.* I then had a data set of the MoMA's exhibition history from 1929-March 14th, 2021 and lastly a data set of The Whitney's exhibition history from 1933-March 30th, 2021.\n\n## Data Preparation:\n\nIn order to create one data set, gardnerjanson_museums, I went through a number of steps to join data from all four in R Studio. I began with binding the rows from the Janson data set and the Gardner data set. I then created a new variable `artist_unique_id` in which I assigned a number to each artist in alphabetical order across all editions of both books. In some cases, there are artists with multiple works cataloged in a particular edition. I was able to sum the total space per work such that an artist's name would only show up once per edition with a `total_space_per_page_total` value in centimeters squared.\n\nPivoting to joining The Whitney's catalog history and the MoMA's catalog history with the data set I just created with both Janson and Gardner observations, I had to create a variable called `whitney_count_to_year` and `moma_count_to_year` respectively. This is because as the publication year of books changes through time, the amount of exhibitions that are given to an artist has the possibility to change through time as well.\n\n`whitney_count_to_year` = The count of exhibitions held by The Whitney of a particular artist at a particular moment of time, as highlighted by `year`.\n\n`moma_count_to_year` = The count of exhibitions held by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) of a particular artist at a particular moment of time, as highlighted by `year`.\n\n## Model Selection:\n\n### Data Preparation for Modeling Purposes:\n\nIn order to prepare my data further for the purposes of regression, I had to re-categorize the variable of `artist_nationality` and `artist_race`. Firstly, since there are myriad nationalities recorded through all 25 books, I had to condense `artist_nationality` to `artist_nationality_other` such that I would only receive five varying betas rather than more than thirty.\n\n`artist_nationality_other` = The nationality of the artist. Of the total count of artists through all editions of *Janson's History of Art* and *Gardner's Art Through the Ages,* 77.32% account for French, Spanish, British, American and German. Therefore, the categorical strings of this variable are French, Spanish, British, American, German and Other.\n\nIn regard to `artist_race`, there are so few observations of artists who are non-white that when running a regression with a categorizing non-white even further into their respective cataloged races with only a handful of data points is not statistically sufficient nor informative. The buckets of information at the respective race-level were too small and therefore rank deficient. Therefore I created the variable `artist_race_nwi`.\n\n`artist_race_nwi` = The non-white indicator for artist race, meaning if an artist's race is denoted as either white or non-white.\n\nLastly, I releveled my data such that the baseline demographic of artist reflects the most common category across `artist_race`, `artist_ethnicity`, `artist_nationality` and `artist_gender` respectively which is a white non-Latinx or Hispanic French man.\n\n### Linear Mixed-Effects Model:\n\nI chose to use a linear mixed-effects model as the data contains a random effect at the artist level as multiple observations in the data can be by the same artist. Using a linear mixed-effects model with artist name as the random effect eliminates the dependence between observations of the same artist, therefore allowing independence to be satisfied for our model. Additionally, I chose to log transform the outcome variable, the total space ratio per page is extremely right-skewed. Performing the log transformation allows for the residuals to have constant variance (homoscedasticity). In regards to choosing the combination of both main fixed effects and interaction fixed effects, I used a step-wise model selection methodology.\n\n# MINE HELP\n\nSatterthwaite test, more flexible, looking directly at p-values - non-parametric test - uses different error term, similar to a two same t-test, similar to ANOVA - analysis of variance - checking between different groups -\n\n# Results\n\n## Descriptive Analysis: Research Question 1\n\nWhat are the demographics (artist race, gender, ethnicity, nationality) of artists included in each edition of *Janson's History of Art* (from 1962-2011) and *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* (from 1926-2020) looking at two-dimensional works after c. 1750?\n\n### **Count Through Editions:**\n\n```{r}\n#| label: gardnercountthroughtime\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-alt: \"There are some respective lulls and peaks through time, as in the fourth edition published in 1959, there are 87 works, while in the fifth published in 1970, there is a significant regression to 69 works.

Such highlights how through time, more works are, on average, continually added to *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* that are two-dimensional and made after c. 1750. The first edition, published in 1926 by Helen Gardner, only has a total of 21 works. Edition 15, published in 2016 as well as edition 16, published in 2020, have 182 works respectively, which is the maximum amount of works through all editions.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: jansoncountthroughtime\n#| echo: false\n\nggplot(gardnerjanson_museums %>% filter(book == \"Janson\"), aes(x = year))+\n  geom_bar(fill = \"dark blue\")+\n  labs(title = \"Overall Count Artists in Janson's History of Art\",\n       x = \"Year of Publication\",\n       y = \"Count\")+\n  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..),\n            stat = \"count\", \n            vjust = -1, \n            colour = \"black\", \n            size = 4)+\n  ylim(0, 200)\n\ngardnerjanson_museums%>%\n  filter(book == \"Janson\") %>%\n  filter(year == \"2011\")\n\n\n```\n\nThe shape of the overall count of works by artists in *Janson's History of Art* is left-skewed, unimodal and asymmetrical. Such highlights how through time, more works are added to *Janson's History of Art* that are two-dimensional and made after c. 1750. There is then a drop-off of works included in the seventh (published in 2007 with 163 works) and eighth (published in 2011 with 153 works) editions, when new authorship took over. Within edition five (published 1995) and edition six (published in 2001), both written by Anthony Janson, there are the same number of works, the maximum amount included in the text throughout time, 185, as compared to the count of works in the first edition, first printing, 62, and first edition, second printing, 76.\n\n### **Gender Through Editions:**\n\n```{r}\n#| label: jansongenderthroughtime\n#| echo: false\n\nggplot(gardnerjanson_museums %>% filter(book == \"Janson\"), aes(x = year, fill = artist_gender))+\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")+\n  labs(title = \"Gender of Artists in Janson's History of Art\",\n       x = \"Year of Publication\",\n       y = \"Proportion\",\n       fill = \"Artist Gender\")+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = .86)\n\njanson_male <- gardnerjanson_museums%>%\n  filter(book == \"Janson\")%>%\n  filter(artist_gender == \"Male\")\n\nartists_janson <- gardnerjanson_museums %>%\n  filter(book == \"Janson\")\n\njan_male <- nrow(janson_male)/nrow(artists_janson)\n  \n```\n\nThe breakdown of artists' gender through editions of *Janson's History of Art,* has never dipped below 86% male, which is what the horizontal line denotes. Additionally, this visualization shows that the first two editions, (the first three books cataloged: edition 1, first printing, edition 1, second printing, and edition 2), that were written my H. W. Janson and Dora Jane Janson, contains no women. Anthony Janson, who took over authorship for the third edition in 1986, began including discourse surrounding female artists. Notably, he was extremely proud of himself for diversifying his family's art history survey text.[^chapter1-35]\n\n[^chapter1-35]: anthony janson interview\n\nThe overall percentage of male artists through all books of *Janson's History of Art* is 89.99%.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: gardnergenderthroughtime\n#| echo: false\n\nggplot(gardnerjanson %>% filter(book == \"gardner\", artist_gender != \"N/A\"), aes(x = year, fill = artist_gender))+\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")+\n  labs(title = \"Gender of Artists in Gardner's Art Through the Ages\",\n       x = \"Year of Publication\",\n       y = \"Proportion\",\n       fill = \"Artist Gender\")+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = .81)\n\ngardner_male <- gardnerjanson_museums%>%\n  filter(book == \"Gardner\")%>%\n  filter(artist_gender == \"Male\")\n\nartists_gardner <- gardnerjanson_museums %>%\n  filter(book == \"Gardner\")\n\ngard_male <- nrow(gardner_male)/nrow(artists_gardner)\n```\n\nThe breakdown of artists' gender through editions of *Gardner's Art Through the Ages,* is marginally more diverse in regard to gender, as the lowest threshold of male artists is just above 81%, which is denoted by the horizontal line. Additionally, this visualization shows that the first edition in 1926 contains no female artists in our scope, but that starting in the second edition in 1936, Helen Gardner began including female artists. *Gardner's History of Art* included female artists in the scope of two-dimensional works after c. 1750 50 years earlier than *Janson's History of Art.*\n\nThe overall percentage of male artists through all books of *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* is 85.69%, roughly a 4.5% increase in regard to gender diversity as compared to *Janson's History of Art.*\n\n### **Race Through Editions:**\n\n```{r}\n#| label: jansonracethroughtime\n#| echo: false\n\nggplot(gardnerjanson_museums %>% filter(book == \"Janson\"), aes(x = year, fill = artist_race))+\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")+\n  labs(title = \"Race of Artists in Janson's History of Art\",\n       x = \"Year of Publication\",\n       y = \"Proportion\",\n       fill = \"Artist Race\")+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = .95)\n\njanson_white <- gardnerjanson_museums%>%\n  filter(book == \"Janson\")%>%\n  filter(artist_race == \"White\")\n\njan_white <- nrow(janson_white)/nrow(artists_janson)\n\njan_black <- gardnerjanson_museums %>%\n  filter(book == \"Janson\") %>%\n  filter(artist_race == \"Black or African American\")\n\njan_black\n```\n\nPivoting to looking at race diversity in *Janson's History of Art* through time, unsurprisingly, the three cataloged books, first two editions written by H. W. Janson and Dora Jane Janson, there were only white artists included. When their son took over authorship, he included a handful of black artists, then in the fifth edition, he added an artist by the name of Kay Walkingstick (1935-present), who is a Native American woman. She was included through the sixth edition then removed when the group of six professors took over.\n\nAnthony Janson states in the fifth edition that Walkingstick combines \"Neo-Expressionism and Neo-Abstraction in a particularly fruitful way...\"[^chapter1-36] The work below was brought forth after the death of her husband in 1989, as she outpours her grief onto the canvas. The left panel, as Janson writes, is \"built up in thick coats of paint applied mainly by her hands,\" with a fan shape in the center which suggests a manmade feature in a primitive landscape and also acts as a sign, investing the canvas mysterious emblematic significance. The right half was painted in an Expressionist style and releases anger through the various layers of color. Walkingstick's diptych display aspects of nature as a spiritual center, of calm contemplation, powerful emotion, and order in chaos.[^chapter1-37]\n\n[^chapter1-36]: Janson edition 5, 834\n\n[^chapter1-37]: Janson fifther edition, 835\n\n![](https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.qIG42Nco8w7CdcuUKuLisgHaDw&pid=Api&P=0&w=338&h=171)\n\nFigure \\_\\_ : Kay WalkingStick, *On The Edge*, 1989. Acrylic and wax and oil on canvas, 81 x 162 ½  cm. Private collection.\n\nInterestingly, the black artists who are included have frequent turnover. The only black artist that enters *Janson's History of Art* in the third edition (1986) and remains through the latest edition (2011) is painter Henry Ossawa Tanner (1859-1937). Notably, in the fifth edition by Anthony Janson, he begins his discourse on Tanner with,\n\nThanks in large part to \\[Thomas\\] Eakins' enlightened attitude, Philadelphia became the leading center of minority artists in the United States. Eakins encouraged women and blacks to study art seriously at a time when professional careers were closed to them. African-Americans has no chance to enter the arts before Emancipation, and after the Civil War the situation improved only gradually. [^chapter1-38]\n\n[^chapter1-38]: Janson's fifth edition, 724.\n\nJanson is seemingly distracted by Tanner's race and how Thomas Eakins provided space for him rather than beginning discourse directly about the aesthetics and significance of Tanner's work itself. He only mentions Tanner's name in the following sentence, allotting only half of the area of text to the history of the artist and the work itself.\n\nIn the fifth edition of Janson's History of Art, Anthony Janson chose to include *The Banjo Lesson,* which he painted after he moved permenantly to Paris, which \"bears Eakins' unmistakable influence.\"[^chapter1-39] Tanner, who is described as the \"first important black painter\" is given space in the text, yet is not properly and independently discussed.\n\n[^chapter1-39]: Janson fifth edition, 724.\n\n![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-peRtVwovs2A/U0QuKv-Cs2I/AAAAAAAAEfs/qyZuN0v5BKM/s1600/1+Henry+Ossawa+Tanner+(American+artist,+1859%25E2%2580%25931937)+The+Banjo+Lesson.jpg){width=\"263\"}\n\nFigure \\_\\_ : Henry Ossawa Tanner, *The Banjo Lesson,* c. 1893.

In Janson's eighth edition, the group of six authors highlights the use of flatness in Hiroshige's composition. The flatness he employs is used to discuss how the \"spatial contraction of Japanese prints certainly influence Degas and Manet...\"[^chapter1-40] Similarly to the example of Tanner, Hiroshige stands as another example of a minority artist included to be compared to the work of a white male artist.\n\n[^chapter1-40]: Janson Edition 8, 871.\n\n![](http://data.ukiyo-e.org/mfa/images/sc126204.jpg){width=\"261\"}\n\nFigure \\_\\_: Ando Hiroshige, *Plum Estate, Kamiedo,* from the series *One Hundred Famous Views of Edo.* 1857.

The most diverse a single edition has gotten thus far is just under 15% being non-white. Interestingly enough, the two editions that are least racially diverse are the seventh and eighth editions which were published in 1980 and 1986 respectively. There is a significant jump in black representation in the eleventh edition, as well as other non-white artists as the percentage of non-white artists goes from just under 4% in the tenth (1996) to close to 14% in the eleventh (2001).\n\nThe first named Asian artist was Suzuki Harunobu in the third edition in 1959.

This may be because the overall count of artists was so few that having only a handful of Hispanic or Latinx artists accounted for just under 9% of the overall count of artists in the 1963 publication.\n\nThe overall percentage of artists who are not Hispanic or Latinx included in *Janson's History of Art* is 95.82%.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: gardnerethnicitythroughtime\n#| echo: false\n\nggplot(gardnerjanson_museums %>% filter(book == \"Gardner\", artist_ethnicity != \"N/A\"), aes(x = year, fill = artist_ethnicity))+\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")+\n  labs(title = \"Ethnicity of Artists in Gardner's Art Through the Ages\",\n       x = \"Year of Publication\",\n       y = \"Proportion\",\n       fill = \"Artist Ethnicity\")+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = .78)+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = .91)\n\ngardner_nhl <- gardnerjanson_museums%>%\n  filter(book == \"Gardner\")%>%\n  filter(artist_ethnicity == \"Not Hispanic or Latinx\")\n\ngard_nhl <- nrow(gardner_nhl)/nrow(artists_gardner)\n```\n\nHelen Gardner's third edition published in 1959 was the most ethnically diverse of all 25 textbooks.

Her efforts are evident through the percentage of Hispanic and Latinx artists, just under 22%. It is clear that her succeeding authors did not continue with such an ethnically diverse selection of artists, which has remained under 9% in every other publication.\n\nThe overall percentage of artists who are not Hispanic or Latinx included in *Janson's History of Art* is 91.51%.\n\n### **Nationality Through Editions:**\n\n```{r}\n#| label: jansonnationalitythroughtime\n#| echo: false\n\nggplot(gardnerjanson_museums %>% filter(book == \"Janson\"), \n       aes(x = year, \n           fill = factor(artist_nationality_other, \n                         levels=c(\"Other\",\n                                  \"Spanish\", \n                                  \"German\", \n                                  \"British\", \n                                  \"French\",\n                                  \"American\"))))+\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")+\n  labs(title = \"Nationality of Artists in Janson's History of Art\",\n       x = \"Year of Publication\",\n       y = \"Proportion\",\n       fill = \"Artist Nationality\")\n\njanson_nonother <- gardnerjanson_museums %>%\n  filter(book == \"Janson\") %>%\n  filter(artist_nationality_other != \"Other\")\n\njan_nonother <- nrow(janson_nonother)/nrow(artists_janson)\n  \n```\n\nIt is clear that *Janson's History of Art* paints a western tradition through the visualization above, highlighting predominantly French, American, British, German, and Spanish artists. Through the first two editions---three books as such include the first edition revised and enlarged published in 1969---the majority nationality is French. Then, when authorship changes from Peter and Dora Janson to Anthony F. Janson in the third edition in 1986, the dominant nationality flips to American. Anthony adds American contemporary artists, such as Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, as well as American photographers such as Dorothea Lange.\n\nThe most consistently represented nationality through editions, however, is French, which could be explained by the type of art highlighted from after c. 1750: Impressionism, Post-Impressionism and Realism. Artists such as Édouard Manet and Claude Monet are French painters who enter the narrative when Peter first writes his discourse published in 1962, and who remain over time even with change in authorship due to their perpetual prominence within the art world.\n\nThe overall percentage of artists who are French, American, British, German or Spanish through all editions of *Janson's History of Art* is 78.51%.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: gardnernationalitythroughtime\n#| echo: false\n\nggplot(gardnerjanson_museums %>% filter(book == \"Gardner\", artist_nationality_other != \"N/A\"), \n       aes(x = year, \n           fill = factor(artist_nationality_other, \n                         levels=c(\"Other\",\n                                  \"Spanish\", \n                                  \"German\", \n                                  \"British\", \n                                  \"French\",\n                                  \"American\"))))+\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")+\n  labs(title = \"Nationality of Artists in Gardner's Art Through the Ages\",\n       x = \"Year of Publication\",\n       y = \"Proportion\",\n       fill = \"Artist Nationality\")\n\ngardner_nonother <- gardnerjanson_museums %>%\n  filter(book == \"Gardner\") %>%\n  filter(artist_nationality_other != \"Other\")\n\ngard_nonother <- nrow(gardner_nonother)/nrow(artists_gardner)\n```\n\nThe spike of the ratio of American artists included in the second edition published in 1936 could be explained by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Federal Art Project during the Great Depression. The US government started funding unemployed artists in the US from 1935 through 1943.\n\nThis visualization also displays a gradual but significant shift in dominance from the percentage of French artists included to American artists from the 1970s through 2020.\n\nThe overall percentage of artists who are French, American, British, German, or Spanish through all editions of *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* is 76.58%.\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis: Research Question 2\n\nWhich variables (artist gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, number of exhibitions at the MoMA or The Whitney) if any, predict the magnitude of an artist's inclusion in art history survey texts (*Janson's History of Art* and *Gardner's Art Through the Ages*)\n\n### Distribution of Total Space Ratio Per Page\n\n```{r}\n#| label: spaceratioperpagetotal\n#| echo: false\n\nggplot(gardnerjanson_museums,\n       aes(x = space_ratio_per_page_total))+\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = .1)+\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Ratio of Space \n       per Artist per Edition per Page in all Textbooks\",\n       x = \"Ratio of Space per Page Total\",\n       y = \"Count\")\n\nmedian(gardnerjanson_museums$space_ratio_per_page_total)\nIQR(gardnerjanson_museums$space_ratio_per_page_total)\n```\n\nThe shape of the visualization above is right-skewed, unimodal and asymmetrical. Therefore, we would want to look at the median to understand its center and interquartile range, which is the middle 50% of the range of the data to understand its spread. The median total space an artist receives is 40.93% of a page. The IQR of total space an artist receives is 28.59% of a page.\n\n### Total Space Ratio Per Page vs. Artist Gender\n\n```{r}\n#| label: genderallbooks\n#| echo: false\n\nggplot(gardnerjanson_museums %>% filter(artist_gender != \"N/A\"), \n       aes(x=artist_gender, y= space_ratio_per_page_total))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  labs(title = \"Ratio of Space per Page per Artist per Edition in \n        by Gender\",\n       x = \"Gender\",\n       y = \"Ratio of Space per Page\")\n\nartists_female <- gardnerjanson_museums %>%\n  filter(artist_gender == \"Female\")\n\nartists_female <- artists_female %>%\n   dplyr::select(artist_name, \n         artist_gender, \n         edition_number, \n         year, \n         book,\n         space_ratio_per_page_total)%>%\n  arrange(desc(space_ratio_per_page_total))\n\nhead(artists_female, 10)\n\nmedian(artists_female$space_ratio_per_page_total)\n\nartists_male <- gardnerjanson_museums %>%\n  filter(artist_gender == \"Male\")\n\nmedian(artists_male$space_ratio_per_page_total)\n\nnrow(artists_female)/nrow(gardnerjanson_museums)\n\n```\n\nInterestingly enough, the median of the total ratio of space per page for female artists is `r round(median(artists_female$space_ratio_per_page_total), 3)`, not far below the median of the total ratio of space per page in centimeters for male artists, `r round(median(artists_male$space_ratio_per_page_total), 3)` through all 25 varying textbooks*.* This indicates that even though the percentage of female artists as compared to male artists is 10.82%, the average amount of space allotted to a female artist is comparable to that of a male.\n\nThat said, there are far more male artists that are given a total ratio of space per page of over 1, meaning over a page of information regarding their work or works. No female has a total ratio of space per page of over 1. The closest female artist to having a page of area given to them is Hannah Höch. In fact, she holds the top three spots of the most area given to a woman in three separate editions: The seventh (2007) and eighth (2011) editions of *Janson's History of Art* and the eleventh edition (2001) of *Gardner's Art Through the Ages.* Her work included, *Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada through the Last Weimar Beer Belly Cultural Epoch of Germany,* stands as an example of photomontage introducing the illogical and chaotic Dadaism.\n\n![](https://gregletson.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/cut-with-the-kitchen-knife-dada-through-the-last-weimar-beer-belly-cultural-epoch-of-germany-1919.jpg?w=392){width=\"299\"}\n\nFigure \\_\\_ : Hannah Höch. *Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada through the Last Weimar Beer Belly Cultural Epoch of Germany.* 1919-1920.

Though the count of each race is far from being comparable, the respective medians per race are as follows: American Indian or Alaska Native, .469, Asian, .344, Black or African American .375, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, .428 and White, .413. With that being said, even though the racial diversity in regard to the ratio of count for white to non-white artists is 92.85%, once an artist is represented, the amount of area given to them is fairly similar in regard to their respectively medians.\n\nObviously, the top quartile of white artists dominates this visualization. White is the only race that has any artists given more than a page of space in any one book. Out of the top ten outliers of white artists, eight of them are Pablo Picasso, with the first five observations being from various editions of *Janson's History of Art.*\n\n### Total Space Ratio Per Page vs. Artist Ethnicity\n\n```{r}\n#| label: ethnicityallbooks\n#| echo: false\n\nggplot(gardnerjanson_museums %>% filter(artist_ethnicity != \"N/A\"),\n       aes(x=artist_ethnicity, y= space_ratio_per_page_total))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  labs(title = \"Ratio of Space per Page per Artist per Edition by Ethnicity\",\n       x = \"Ethnicity\",\n       y = \"Ratio of Space per Page\")\n\nartists_HL <- gardnerjanson_museums %>%\n  filter(artist_ethnicity == \"Hispanic or Latinx\")\n\nmedian(artists_HL$space_ratio_per_page_total)\n\nartists_NHL <- gardnerjanson_museums %>%\n  filter(artist_ethnicity == \"Not Hispanic or Latinx\")\n\nmedian(artists_NHL$space_ratio_per_page_total)\n```\n\nInterestingly, the median for the total space ratio per page for artists who are Hispanic or Latinx, `round(median(janson_HL$space_ratio_per_page_total), 3)` is higher than those who are Not Hispanic or Latinx, `round(median(janson_NHL$space_ratio_per_page_total), 3)`. There are `nrow(janson_HL)` observations of artists per edition who are Hispanic and Latinx and there are `nrow(janson_NHL)` observations of artists per edition who are not Hispanic or Latinx. Picasso plays a large role in such, as he is Hispanic or Latinx and is accounting for the outlyingly larger observations for `space_ratio_per_page_total`.\n\n### Total Space Ratio Per Page vs. Artist

right-skewed, my linear mixed-effects model yields a conditional r squared of 53.23%. Such denotes that 53.23% of the variance of total space ratio per page given to an artist in a given edition can be explained by the model.\n\n# Discussion\n\n## Model Interpretation and Relevance\n\nIn the visualization above, the slopes with any asterisk are the slopes that have a p-value smaller than .05, denoting that they are statistically significant. We can reject the null hypothesis that the relationship between the given predictors with any asterisk has a slope that is not equal to 0. The following denotes the interpretation for the intercept and every predicted slope the model outputs as statistically significant:\n\nIntercept: For an American artist with no exhibitions at the MoMA, we expect on average for the space_ratio_per_page to multiply by a factor of `r round(exp(.988), 3)`.\n\nFrench: Holding all else constant, for a French artist, we expect the total space ratio per page to increase on average by `r round(exp(.233), 3)` as compared to an American artist.\n\nSpanish: Holding all else constant, for a Spanish artist, we expect the total space ratio per page to increase on average by `r round(exp(.571), 3)` as compared to an American artist.\n\nFrench x MoMA Count to Year: For a French artist, for an additional exhibition at the MoMA, we expect total space ratio per page to increase by a factor `r round(exp(.023 - .011), 3)`, as compared to an American artist.\n\nOther x MoMA Count to Year: For an artist with a nationality different from American, French, British, German and Spanish, for an additional exhibition at the MoMA, we expect total space ratio per page to increase by a factor `r round(exp(.015 - .011), 3)`, as compared to an American artist.\n\nGerman x MoMA Count to Year: For a German artist, for an additional exhibition at the MoMA, we expect total space ratio per page to increase by a factor `r round(exp(.022 - .011), 3)`, as compared to an American artist.\n\nSpanish x MoMA Count to Year: For a Spanish artist, for an additional exhibition at the MoMA, we expect total space ratio per page to increase by a factor `r round(exp(.032 - .011), 3)`, as compared to an American artist.\n\nThe goal of my model is to understand and infer which variables are most statistically significant when accounting for the variance of the total space ratio per page per artist per edition. The goal of the model is not prediction, but rather inference and to identify which variables, out my the possible six predictors (artist gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, MoMA count to year and Whitney count to year) that I collected, explain the variability of my outcome variable. Creating a model that focuses on inference allows for me to see the most important predictors spanning from 1926-2020 of two-dimensional works made after c. 1750 included in either *Janson's History of Art* or *Gardner's Art Through the Ages.*\n\n## Limitations and Next Steps\n\nThat being said, the best fit model is limited by the imbalances in the data that I collected and highlighted through answering my first research question of how the demographic of artists included in the books change through time. There are incredible imbalances particularly when it comes to race, gender, and ethnicity. Mathematically, my model struggled with rank deficiencies, meaning there were so few observations of artists who are in a minority group either in regard to being female or non-white or being of Hispanic or Latino origin. My model is most generalizable for an audience of American white male from not Hispanic or Latino origin as this demographic is most dominant through the data I collected in *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* and *Janson's History of Art.* With more diverse data that potentially the future of art history introductory survey texts holds, one could achieve a model in which those demographic categories account for the variability of total space ratio per page per artist per edition.\n\nAdditionally, my research is limited to the lack of transparency in the sales of art. I would have loved to create a variable using price data of works of artists in an effort to quantify the relationship between various art markets and art history introductory textbooks. Additionally, due to time constraints, I would have loved to have created a variable counting the number of external publications written about a particular artist at each moment of time in which another edition of either *Janson's History of Art* or *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* was published. This would have been in an effort to quantify the relationship between art history survey texts and external publications. Additionally, there are potential gaps in information regarding the exhibition history at The Whitney as it is only the exhibitions as stated by their website in March of 2021, rather than a fully complete exhibition history. I would love to as well as a next step to be able to have used exhibition history's of other museums not only in the United States but across the world to better understand the relationship between museum spaces art history introductory survey texts. Additionally, there are myriad other art history survey texts one could catalog, as well as expanding the scope within the 25 books from which I did record data.\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Log Transformation: Total Space Ratio per Page\n\n```{r}\n#| label: logspaceratioperpagetotal\n#| echo: false\n\nggplot(gardnerjanson_museums,\n       aes(x = log(space_ratio_per_page_total)))+\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = .1)+\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of the Log of Ratio of Space \n       per Artist per Edition per Page in all Textbooks\",\n       x = \"Ratio of Space per Page Total\",\n       y = \"Count\")\n```\n\nIn order to create less skew in our outcome variable, it is evident that log transforming total space ratio per page given to an artist in a particular edition gives the spread a much more mild right-skew than before. The shape is still unimodal and asymmetrical. I will be using the log transformation on the total space ratio per page, our outcome variable, in the linear mixed-effects model. This allows for the residuals to have constant variance.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n### Residuals and Constant Variance\n\n```{r}\n#| label: resid\n#| echo: false\n\nplot(resid(lmm, type = \"pearson\") ~ fitted(lmm))\n```\n\nThe very low values of the predicted values have very low variability for residuals but for the bulk of the data, there is constant variability in the residuals.\n\n### Normality\n\n```{r}\n#| label: density-histogram\n#| echo: false\n\nlmm_aug <- broom.mixed::augment(lmm, gardnerjanson_museums_mod)\n\nggplot(lmm_aug, aes(x = .resid))+\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = .05, aes(y = after_stat(density)))+\n  theme_minimal()+ \n  stat_function(fun = dnorm,\n                args = list(mean = mean(lmm_aug$.resid),\n                            sd = sd(lmm_aug$.resid)),\n                color = \"red\",\n                size = 2)\n```\n\nThe distribution of the residuals is approximately normal.\n\n### Linearity\n\n```{r}\n#| label: linearitymoma\n#| echo: false\n\nggplot(lmm_aug, aes(x = moma_count_to_year, y = .resid)) +\n  geom_point(position=position_jitter(h=0.1, w=0.1), alpha = 0.5, size = 1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Residuals by MoMA Count to Year\",\n    x = \"Count to Year\",\n    y = \"Residuals\"\n  )\n```\n\nThere is no pattern left behind therefore linearity is satisfied. There is a linear relationship between the response and predictor variables. (not sure if this is correct)\n\n### Independence\n\nSince we are using a mixed-effects model, and our random effect is per artist, we eliminate the dependence of our observations had we not used a mixed-effects model. Between artists, we expect the observations to be independent.\n\n### Collinearity\n\n```{r}\n#| label: collinearity\n#| echo: false\n\nvif(lmm)\n```\n\nGiven artist nationality, MoMA Count to Year and the interaction between the two all have a corrected GVIF under 10 therefore no variables are collinear.\n\n## Data Dictionary\n\nOutcome:\n\n`space_ratio_per_page_total` = The area in centimeters squared of both the text and the figure of a particular artist in a given edition of *Janson's History of Art* divided by the area in centimeters squared of a single page of the respective edition.\n\nPotential Predictors:\n\n`artist_gender` = The gender of the artist.\n\n`artist_race` = The race of the artist.\n\n`artist_race_nwi` = The non-white indicator for artist race, meaning if an artist's race is denoted as either white or non-white.\n\n`artist_ethnicity` = The ethnicity of the artist.\n\n`artist_nationality_other` = The nationality of the artist. Of the total count of artists through all editions of *Gardner's Art Through the Ages* and *Janson's History of Art*, 77.32% account for French, Spanish, British, American and German. Therefore, the categorical strings of this variable are French, Spanish, British, American, German and Other.\n\n`whitney_count_to_year` = The count of exhibitions held by The Whitney of a particular artist at a particular moment of time, as highlighted by `year`.\n\n`moma_count_to_year` = The count of exhibitions held by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) of a particular artist at a particular moment of time, as highlighted by `year`.\n\n`year` = The year of publication for a given edition of Janson or Gardner.\n\nOther variables:\n\n`edition_number` = The edition number of the textbook from either Janson's History of Art or Gardner's Art Through the Ages.\n\n`book` = Which book, either Janson or Gardner the particular artist at that particular time was included.\n\n`artist_unique_id` = A unique identifying number assigned to artists across books and editions denoted in alphabetical order.\n\n# Bibliography\n\n\"100 Best-Selling Art History Books of All Time.\" Book Authority.\\\nhttps://bookauthority.org/books/best-selling-art-history-books.  \n\nBolin, Paul E. \"Discussions and Depictions of Women in H.
